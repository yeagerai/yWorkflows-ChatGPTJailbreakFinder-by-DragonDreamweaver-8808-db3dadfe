# ChatGPTJailbreakFinder Component Documentation

## 1. Component Name

ChatGPTJailbreakFinder

## 2. Description

The ChatGPTJailbreakFinder component is a building block in a Yeager Workflow specifically designed to find the top jailbreaks given a Google Sheet ID and a URL. This Yeager component performs the necessary data retrieval, processing, and formatting steps to return the top jailbreaks information.

## 3. Input and Output Models

### Input Model:

* `ChatGPTJailbreakFinderIn` - A `BaseModel` subclass with the following fields:
    * `url: str` - The URL used for data fetching.
    * `google_sheet_id: str` - Google Sheet ID used for fetching data from Google Sheets.

### Output Model:

* `ChatGPTJailbreakFinderOut` - A `BaseModel` subclass with the following fields:
    * `top_jailbreaks: List[str]` - A list of top jailbreaks in string format.

These models handle validation and serialization using Pydantic's `BaseModel`.

## 4. Parameters

* `args: ChatGPTJailbreakFinderIn` - An instance of the input model containing the URL and Google Sheet ID.
* `callbacks: typing.Any` - Callback functions for any additional processing steps. Defaults to `None`.

## 5. Transform Function

The `transform()` method of the ChatGPTJailbreakFinder component is an asynchronous method that performs the following steps:

1. Calls the `transform()` method of the superclass (AbstractWorkflow) with provided `args` and `callbacks`.
2. Fetches data from external sources using the URL and Google Sheet ID.
3. Performs data processing and extraction of the top jailbreaks information.
4. Creates an instance of the output model `ChatGPTJailbreakFinderOut` filled with the `top_jailbreaks` data.
5. Returns the output model instance.

## 6. External Dependencies

* `typing`: For type hints and annotations.
* `dotenv`: For loading environment variables.
* `fastapi`: For creating the FastAPI application.
* `pydantic`: For creating input and output models, as well as for validation and serialization.

## 7. API Calls

This component does not directly make API calls. However, the superclass `AbstractWorkflow` may have additional steps that involve API calls when fetching data using the URL and Google Sheet ID.

## 8. Error Handling

As the `transform()` method relies on the superclass implementation, error handling primarily stems from the `AbstractWorkflow` component. Specific exceptions and error messages will be raised by the superclass according to the processing steps and requirements of that component.

## 9. Examples

To use the ChatGPTJailbreakFinder component within a Yeager Workflow, you can create and configure instances of the required input model and the component itself:
